# Welcome to PIPupdate.
An easy-to-use PIP package updater for Python.
(coming January 2017 as I actually have to code it and compile it!)

# Requirements
* Python 3 (a Python 2 port will come after release)
* PIP (it's in the name, folks.)

# Setting up PIPupdate
It's easy. And it isn't a pain in the neck.

* Download the ZIP provided in the releases tab, and extract it.
* Linux Users: You can also run the command "https://github.com/o355/pipupdate.git --depth=1" to download/extract it.
* Open a terminal prompt in that location, and type in "python pipupdate.py"
* For Linux users, use "python3 pipupdate.py"
* The updater will do it's thing!
